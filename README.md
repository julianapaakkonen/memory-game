# Memory Game

## Description
This is a memory game for one player. The player can choose from two board sizes: S (4x4) or L (6x6). The player chooses two cards and the game checks if those two cards contain the same picture. The game informs the player if the cards match and how many pairs are left. When all pairs are found the game ends and the number of tries is shown.

This was a project for my object-oriented programming studies.
